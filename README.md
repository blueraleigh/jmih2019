These are some materials I prepared for a comparative methods workshop organized by Brian Sidlauskas and Hannah Owens at the 2019 Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists in Snowbird, Utah. Other instructors for the workshop were Mike Burns and Leonard Jones.

This portion of the workshop covered some of the basics of continuous-time Markov chain models as used in macroevolutionary studies of trait evolution.
